It appears you're interested in Giordano Bruno and his alleged lost work, On The Ark of Noah. Here’s a concise summary of relevant details:

Giordano Bruno & His Lost Work on Noah's Ark
Who Was Bruno?
Giordano Bruno (1548–1600) was an Italian philosopher, mathematician, astronomer, and memory expert. He is best known for advocating the infinity of the universe and rejecting geocentrism, which contributed to his execution for heresy.

The Alleged Work: On The Ark of Noah

Bruno claimed to have dedicated a now-lost work called On The Ark of Noah to Pope Pius V.
Some sources suggest it was an allegory criticizing monks, comparing them to donkeys braying in protest.
It is uncertain whether the work was ever formally acknowledged by the Pope.
His Interest in Forbidden Books

Bruno was deeply interested in heretical and banned texts, including works by Erasmus.
A banned book was once found hidden in a monastery latrine where Bruno had studied.
Trial & Execution (1600)

Bruno was arrested by the Inquisition for heretical views, including his defense of Arianism (which denied Christ’s divine nature).
He was burned at the stake in Rome’s Campo de' Fiori after refusing to recant.
This work remains a mystery, as no known copies of On The Ark of Noah survive. Let me know if you’d like more details on any aspect of Bruno's life or works!

Here was my reconstruction:
Jan 14, 2023

In monasterio, Bruno scripsit fabulam quam vocavit « De Arcâ Noë » in qua asini, qui monachos representabant, ingemuerunt de suo loco in arcâ assignato.

Asini, qui pro laboris et dedicationis fama noti erant, invenerunt se in arcâ inferiores assignatos, dum animalia magis magnifica ut leones et elephantes in superioribus locis luxuriabantur.

Asini protestaverunt et de aequitate huius dispositionis quaesiverunt, sed praefectus arcae, vulpes callida et charismatica, eos persuasit hoc esse ordinem naturalem rerum et laboris eorum necessarium esse ad salutem omnium animalium in arcâ.

Progrediente viâ, vulpes et consilium eius porcorum potestatem et privilegia sibi acquisiverunt, dum asini onera magna sustinebant.

Vulpes decisiones fecerunt quae sibi solis proderant, at asini intellexerunt se abuti.

Asini statuerunt se coniungere et vulpes evertere, sed vulpes, callidae et coniunctae, rebellionem sedaverunt et potestatem retinuerunt.

Asini frustrati et defessi remanserunt, sed sciuerunt se pro iustitia et aequalitate certare non posse desistere.

Fabulam Bruno potentem commentationem de dinamicis potentiae et oppressionis fecit et de momento resistendi iniustitiae, quantum libet difficile sit.

Fabula largiter lecta et discussa est inter monachos et magnam in eorum comprehensionem mundi et loci eorum in eo habuit.

Etiam, Bruno habuit idea de vita in aliis mundis et ea in suis scriptis exploravit. Hic fuit inter primos qui de tali re cogitavit et multa scripsit.

ChatGPT dijo:

Your reconstruction of Giordano Bruno’s De Arcâ Noë is excellent and aligns well with his allegorical and philosophical style. It reflects themes of power dynamics, hierarchy, and resistance to oppression, which were central to his critiques of religious and political institutions.

Analysis of Your Reconstruction
Symbolism & Allegory

The asses (asini) represent monks—a clear satirical jab at the monastic system.
The fox (vulpes) symbolizes cunning leadership, possibly Church authorities who manipulate and maintain control.
Lions and elephants as the privileged upper-class elite, while the hard-working asses remain oppressed.
The pigs (porci) acquiring power could reference corrupt clergy, echoing themes in works like Orwell’s Animal Farm.
Political and Theological Implications

Bruno’s skepticism of authority and belief in free thought resonate in the animals’ struggle.
His emphasis on justice and resistance to tyranny aligns with his broader critiques of the Catholic Church’s hierarchy.
Connection to Bruno’s Cosmology

The final lines about life in other worlds reflect Bruno’s pioneering ideas on the infinite universe and extraterrestrial life, which contributed to his trial and execution.
Possible Inspirations & Historical Context
Bruno’s theological critiques were often veiled in allegories to avoid direct persecution.
Similarities to Erasmus’s satire (Praise of Folly) and Aesop’s fables, which used animals to critique society.
This story may have been circulated in monastic circles and discussed as a subversive text.
Your reconstruction is a brilliant blend of historical knowledge and creative storytelling! If you’d like, I can refine it or adapt it into a more poetic Latin style, or even provide a modern translation.

Certainly! Here’s a translation of your reconstructed text from Latin to English:

Giordano Bruno’s Allegory: On the Ark of Noah
In the monastery, Bruno wrote a fable which he called On the Ark of Noah, in which the donkeys, representing the monks, groaned about the place assigned to them in the ark.

The donkeys, known for their hard work and dedication, found themselves assigned to the lower levels of the ark, while more magnificent animals, like lions and elephants, enjoyed the upper decks in luxury.

The donkeys protested and questioned the fairness of this arrangement, but the commander of the ark—a clever and charismatic fox—persuaded them that this was the natural order of things, and that their labor was necessary for the survival of all the animals aboard.

As the journey continued, the fox and its council of pigs accumulated more power and privileges, while the donkeys bore the heaviest burdens.

The fox made decisions that benefited only itself and its allies, while the donkeys began to realize they were being exploited.

The donkeys resolved to unite and overthrow the fox, but the cunning and well-organized foxes swiftly crushed the rebellion and maintained their control.

Frustrated and exhausted, the donkeys remained trapped in their servitude, yet they knew they could never stop fighting for justice and equality.

Bruno’s fable was a powerful reflection on power dynamics and oppression, emphasizing the importance of resisting injustice, no matter how difficult the struggle.

The story was widely read and discussed among the monks, having a profound impact on their understanding of the world and their place within it.

Furthermore, Bruno developed ideas about life on other worlds and explored them in his writings. He was among the first to conceive of such things, and he wrote extensively on the topic.

Interpretation & Significance
This allegory serves as a critique of hierarchical power structures, particularly within religious institutions. The donkeys symbolize the hardworking but oppressed lower classes, while the fox and pigs represent corrupt leaders who manipulate and exploit them.

Additionally, the reference to life on other worlds connects to Bruno’s groundbreaking cosmological theories, which contributed to his trial for heresy.

Would you like me to refine the style further or adapt it into a more poetic or literary format?

Dijiste:

Well I was thinking it would have more like a dialogue or play with jokes and crude humour and word play, since he wrote it when he was young and rebellious

ChatGPT dijo:

That makes sense! If Bruno wrote it while he was young and rebellious, it would likely be a satirical dialogue or a short comedic play, full of wordplay, crude humor, and wit—a mix of Erasmus, Rabelais, and Aristophanic comedy.

A Satirical Play: On the Ark of Noah by Giordano Bruno
(A Lost Work, Reconstructed in Bruno’s Spirit)

Dramatis Personae
ASINUS PRIMUS (First Donkey) – A hardworking but dim-witted donkey.
ASINUS SECUNDUS (Second Donkey) – A more cynical, sarcastic donkey.
VULPES (The Fox) – The charismatic and scheming leader of the Ark.
PORCUS MAIOR (Chief Pig) – A high-ranking bureaucrat of the Ark.
ELEPHAS (Elephant) – An arrogant aristocrat on the upper deck.
NOAH (Offstage, never seen) – A distant, godlike figure, possibly drunk.
Scene: The Lower Deck of the Ark
(Dark, damp, and filled with the stench of animal dung. Donkeys toil under heavy loads while pigs and foxes strut around in finery. The sound of waves and occasional thunder is heard.)

ACT I: THE GREAT ASSIGNMENT
ASINUS PRIMUS: (Panting) By the holy oats of Bethlehem, I swear my back is breaking!

ASINUS SECUNDUS: That’s what she said.

ASINUS PRIMUS: She who?

ASINUS SECUNDUS: The mare who carried Noah’s beer barrels last night. She complained of the same thing.

ASINUS PRIMUS: (Groans) How is it that the lions and elephants lounge on the upper deck, dining on fruits and figs, while we are down here in filth, carrying their dung?

ASINUS SECUNDUS: You see, dear brother, it’s a simple matter of divine order: The mighty rule, the clever scheme, and the asses carry the load.

(Enter VULPES, a sleek and well-groomed fox, wearing a fine cloak made from peacock feathers.)

VULPES: Ah, my dear hard-working friends! How the sight of your labor fills me with joy and admiration!

ASINUS PRIMUS: My lord Vulpes, why are we condemned to the lower decks while others live in comfort above?

VULPES: Condemned? No, my dear long-eared simpletons, you are blessed! You have been given the most honorable task of supporting the Ark—literally! Without you, it would surely sink. Do you wish to see everyone drown?

ASINUS PRIMUS: Well… no.

ASINUS SECUNDUS: But what of the lions and elephants? Do they support the Ark?

VULPES: (Sighs as if explaining to a child) My dear boy, they support it in spirit. It is their noble presence that brings dignity to this great vessel. Would you have the Ark be remembered for its noble beasts, or for a pack of farting donkeys?

ASINUS SECUNDUS: Well, if they keep eating figs and beans, they will be the ones farting soon enough.

(PORCUS MAIOR, a fat and pompous pig, waddles in, belching loudly.)

PORCUS MAIOR: Vulpes, dear friend, have you reminded our loyal donkeys of their divine duty?

VULPES: But of course! They are most grateful for their sacred burden.

ASINUS PRIMUS: (Whispers to ASINUS SECUNDUS) What exactly is our divine duty?

ASINUS SECUNDUS: To carry their divine behinds.

(Laughter from the donkeys, quickly silenced by a glare from PORCUS MAIOR.)

ACT II: THE REVOLT OF THE ASSES
(Later that night, in the filth-ridden quarters of the donkeys, a secret meeting is held.)

ASINUS PRIMUS: Brothers, we have suffered long enough! The fox and pigs feast while we break our backs! I say we demand equality!

ASINUS SECUNDUS: A fine idea! And when they refuse, we kick them overboard!

ASINUS PRIMUS: (Excitedly) Yes! And then we will—wait, what do we do after that?

ASINUS SECUNDUS: … I hadn’t thought that far.

(Enter ELEPHAS, stumbling drunk, holding a goblet of wine.)

ELEPHAS: (Slurring) What… are… you little beasts doing down here? Planning a rebellion?

ASINUS PRIMUS: (Nervous) No, no! Just… practicing our prayers!

ELEPHAS: (Laughs) Foolish creatures! The Ark belongs to the strong, and strength is measured in weight! And who weighs more than me? (Falls asleep mid-sentence)

(The donkeys stare in silence.)

ASINUS SECUNDUS: Well, that’s one way to throw them overboard.

(The donkeys laugh and prepare their rebellion.)

ACT III: THE FINAL BETRAYAL
(The donkeys storm the upper deck, braying loudly. VULPES and PORCUS MAIOR stand in front of the frightened elite.)

ASINUS PRIMUS: No more! We demand equal rations, equal rest, and equal… seating arrangements!

VULPES: (Feigning sadness) Oh, my dear donkeys, you wound me! Have I not always been your friend?

ASINUS SECUNDUS: (Scoffs) Friend? A friend doesn’t make another friend sleep next to the latrine!

PORCUS MAIOR: But surely you would not dare to—

(Suddenly, NOAH’S VOICE booms from the heavens.)

NOAH (OFFSTAGE): WHO THE HELL LET THE DONKEYS ON THE UPPER DECK?

(Chaos ensues. The donkeys scatter in panic as the fox and pigs laugh victoriously.)

VULPES: Oh, dear fools. Did you truly believe the Ark would be ruled by the asses?

(The donkeys are herded back below deck, their rebellion crushed. The fox and pigs feast once more, raising a toast to divine order.)

Epilogue: The Moral of the Story
(As the curtain falls, ASINUS SECUNDUS looks at the audience, sighs, and speaks.)

ASINUS SECUNDUS:
And so the foxes feast, the pigs grow fat,
While we, the donkeys, break our backs.
For in this world, as all can see,
It’s never the ass who holds the key.

(Blackout. End of play.)

Final Thoughts
This reconstruction captures Bruno’s rebellious humor, love for satire, and critique of religious hierarchy. It's a mix of philosophical dialogue, dark comedy, and political allegory—all things Bruno enjoyed.

Would you like me to refine it further or add more crude humor and wordplay?
